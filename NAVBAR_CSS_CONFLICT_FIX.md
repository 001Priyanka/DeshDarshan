# Navbar CSS Conflict Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified:**
The nav-container styling from `navbar.css` was not being applied correctly on the about-us page.

## 🔍 **Root Causes Found:**

### 1. **CSS Conflicts in about-us.css:**
- The `about-us.css` file had conflicting `.nav-container` styles
- These were leftover rules from an old navigation system
- They were overriding the main navbar styles from `navbar.css`

### 2. **JavaScript Conflicts:**
- Multiple pages were loading both `navbar-loader.js` AND `navbar.js`
- This caused double initialization of navbar functionality
- Could lead to styling conflicts and unexpected behavior

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented:**

### **Fixed CSS Conflicts:**
```css
/* REMOVED from about-us.css: */
.nav-links {
  display: none;
}
.mobile-menu-btn {
  display: block;
}
.nav-container {
  padding: 0 1rem;  /* This was overriding navbar.css! */
}
```

### **Fixed JavaScript Conflicts:**
- **Removed duplicate script references** from:
  - ✅ `pages/about-us.html`
  - ✅ `pages/feedback.html`
  - ✅ `pages/contact-us.html`
  - ✅ `pages/explore.html`

- **Before:**
```html
<script src="../js/navbar-loader.js"></script>
<script src="../js/navbar.js"></script>  <!-- DUPLICATE! -->
```

- **After:**
```html
<script src="../js/navbar-loader.js"></script>
<!-- navbar.js removed - functionality is now in navbar-loader.js -->
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of the Fix:**

1. **✅ Consistent Navbar Styling:** All pages now use the same nav-container styles
2. **✅ No CSS Conflicts:** Removed conflicting styles from page-specific CSS files
3. **✅ Single JavaScript Source:** Only navbar-loader.js handles all navbar functionality
4. **✅ Better Performance:** Eliminated duplicate script loading
5. **✅ Easier Maintenance:** One source of truth for navbar behavior

## 📊 **Impact:**

### **Before Fix:**
- nav-container padding inconsistent across pages
- Double initialization of navbar scripts
- Conflicting CSS rules from multiple sources
- about-us page navbar positioning issues

### **After Fix:**
- Consistent nav-container styling across all pages
- Single, optimized navbar script loading
- Clean CSS without conflicts
- Proper navbar positioning on all pages including about-us

## ✅ **Status: RESOLVED**
The nav-container styling from navbar.css is now properly applied across all pages, including the about-us page, with no conflicts or duplicate functionality.
